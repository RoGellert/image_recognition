# University project implementing symbol recognition of a few symbols from omniglot dataset

Relevant information and my thought process is inside the notebook =)

DBM implementation: https://github.com/flavio2018/Deep-Belief-Network-pytorch who forked from https://github.com/mehulrastogi/Deep-Belief-Network-pytorch

Libraries: pytorch, sklearn, scipy

Project consists of implementing DBN, FFNN, studying internal representations, 
perceptive fields, robustness to noise (etc.).
I have augmented the dataset using pytorch transforms
